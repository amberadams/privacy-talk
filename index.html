						<h2>The Onion Router</h2>
						<img width="550" height="423" src="images/ogresonions.jpg"></p>
						<aside class="notes">
						Onion routing was conceived in the mid-90s by the US Naval Research Laboratory, and initially developed into what is now known as the TOR network in 2002. It was designed for the primary purpose of protecting government communications, and secondarily to give citizens in other countries living under anti-democratic censorship a means of accessing the Internet with less threat of government reprisal. Today it's used by a wide range of people even beyond the usual suspects, which of course includes the military, journalists, dissidents and activists, law enforcement, and criminals.

						</p>
						<img width="559" height="432" src="images/analysis.png"></p>
						<aside class="notes">
						When we connect to the Internet without any proxy or encryption in place, we are broadcasting a great deal of information about our location, our computer system and its potential weaknesses, what sites or servers we are connecting to as well as all of the information we are transmitting to those sites and servers. It's quite simple for a bad actor, whether that's our own government or a stalker or other hacker, to use a packet sniffer like Wireshark to analyze your traffic and learn an awful lot about you and even steal your information such as logins and passwords. I've included a few links here for your reference just to get a feel for how much information we're potentially revealing and how easy it is for someone else to capture.

						<h2>Proxies & Encryption</h2>
						<img width="670" height="368" src="images/tor-onion.png"></p>

						<aside class="notes">
						TOR solves the privacy problem of traffic analysis in two ways: through anonymity and encryption. TOR will route your network traffic through three nodes before reaching the destination via the last node (called an exit node). At each node, the request is encrypted using the public key of the next node in the chain, thereby creating a layer of encryption at each level and fulfilling the onion metaphor. The same process happens in reverse with the response. Of course, this means that your traffic is most vulnerable to eavesdropping when leaving the onion routing network, so ideally your sensitive communications should take place entirely within the network.
						Tor is a service that helps you to protect your anonymity while using the Internet.

						<h2>Hidden Services</h2>
						<p>Explore the <a href="http://thehiddenwiki.org/">Deep, Dark, Mysterious Net</a>.</p>
						<p>Host your own <a href="https://github.com/whackashoe/tor-hidden-service-setup">hidden services</a> on a virtual machine.</p>
						<p>Host your own <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5952148/how-to-create-a-super-private-bittorrent-community-for-you-and-your-friends">torrents</a> while you're at it, too.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							A hidden service needs to advertise its existence in the Tor network before clients will be able to contact it. Therefore, the service randomly picks some relays, builds circuits to them, and asks them to act as introduction points by telling them its public key. By using a full Tor circuit, it's hard for anyone to associate an introduction point with the hidden server's IP address. While the introduction points and others are told the hidden service's identity or public key, they don't know the hidden server's actual location or IP address. 
							
							The hidden service assembles a hidden service descriptor, containing its public key and a summary of each introduction point, and signs this descriptor with its private key. It uploads that descriptor to a distributed hash table. The descriptor will be found by clients requesting XYZ.onion where XYZ is a 16 character name derived from the service's public key. After this step, the hidden service is set up. 
							
							A client that wants to contact a hidden service needs to learn about its onion address first. After that, the client can initiate connection establishment by downloading the descriptor from the distributed hash table. If there is a descriptor for XYZ.onion (the hidden service could also be offline or have left long ago, or there could be a typo in the onion address), the client now knows the set of introduction points and the right public key to use. Around this time, the client also creates a circuit to another randomly picked relay and asks it to act as rendezvous point by telling it a one-time secret. 
							
							It's unfortunate that the Dark Net is used by criminals such as pedophiles, but it has the potential to be an Internet relatively immune from other types of government censorship that most of us would probably not approve of.

						<h2>THE COMMAND LINE</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
						If you've never operated your computer from the command line but have always used a GUI (graphical user interface), then you are severely limiting what you can do on your computer. You might even be causing yourself unnecessary pain. In the beginning, all operations on your computer were done from a command line. There were no GUIs. Of course, Mac and Windows came along and changed all that, and it made computers simpler to use for a much wider range of people. Unfortunately, the GUI interface still remained underpowered in comparison to the command line. To this day, there are operations that are trivial on the command line that are impossible from the GUI, and some things you can do in the GUI that are still far more efficient from the command line. One of my frustrations with Windows, in fact, is how many different programs are written and even sold for cash money that perform the sorts of operations that can be done using a UNIX command line from a free as in beer operating system with just a few keystrokes. This is also illustrated by the Automator program on Macs, if any of you have played with that. Apple took various generic UNIX commands - like, "divide this file into many files by paragraphs" or "create a pdf" and attached them to buttons which can be placed in whatever order you wish them to run, with a file input and an output. Or you could just use the command line by typing in the text commands and running the script without bothering with Automator, which frankly by comparison feels a little slow and clunky and limiting to me, even though it allows you to write and run scripts in the GUI. I encourage all of you to dive into using the command line, not only because you need it for some of the privacy and security things we're about to do, but because it will make you a much powerful computer user. It might seem weird at first if you've never used it, but it's really not that mysterious once you learn a few simple commands.

						<h2>GNUPG</h2>
						<img width="448" height="274" src="images/security.png">
						<aside class="notes">
						Pretty Good Privacy enables you to encrypt your email and files, and also ensure that the people you think you are emailing are really the people you are emailing. You do this by creating a public and private key for yourself using cryptographic sotware. The person on the other end of the communication also creates their own public and private key. You exchange public keys. When you encrypt email destined for that person, your system encrypts it in such a way that only that person's system with its private key installed can decrypt it. We will be using GNUPG, also known as GPG, to accomplish this. Although it's probably the best option available, it's not trivial to get it running.
