						<h2>The Onion Router</h2>
						<img width="550" height="423" src="images/ogresonions.jpg"></p>
						<aside class="notes">
						Onion routing was conceived in the mid-90s by the US Naval Research Laboratory, and initially developed into what is now known as the TOR network in 2002. It was designed for the primary purpose of protecting government communications, and secondarily to give citizens in other countries living under anti-democratic censorship a means of accessing the Internet with less threat of government reprisal. Today it's used by a wide range of people even beyond the usual suspects, which of course includes the military, journalists, dissidents and activists, law enforcement, and criminals.

						</p>
						<img width="559" height="432" src="images/analysis.png"></p>
						<aside class="notes">
						When we connect to the Internet without any proxy or encryption in place, we are broadcasting a great deal of information about our location, our computer system and its potential weaknesses, what sites or servers we are connecting to as well as all of the information we are transmitting to those sites and servers. It's quite simple for a bad actor, whether that's our own government or a stalker or other hacker, to use a packet sniffer like Wireshark to analyze your traffic and learn an awful lot about you and even steal your information such as logins and passwords. I've included a few links here for your reference just to get a feel for how much information we're potentially revealing and how easy it is for someone else to capture.

						<h2>Proxies & Encryption</h2>
						<img width="670" height="368" src="images/tor-onion.png"></p>

						<aside class="notes">
						TOR solves the privacy problem of traffic analysis in two ways: through anonymity and encryption. TOR will route your network traffic through three nodes before reaching the destination via the last node (called an exit node). At each node, the request is encrypted using the public key of the next node in the chain, thereby creating a layer of encryption at each level and fulfilling the onion metaphor. The same process happens in reverse with the response. Of course, this means that your traffic is most vulnerable to eavesdropping when leaving the onion routing network, so ideally your sensitive communications should take place entirely within the network.

						<h2>THE COMMAND LINE</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
						If you've never operated your computer from the command line but have always used a GUI (graphical user interface), then you are severely limiting what you can do on your computer. You might even be causing yourself unnecessary pain. In the beginning, all operations on your computer were done from a command line. There were no GUIs. Of course, Mac and Windows came along and changed all that, and it made computers simpler to use for a much wider range of people. Unfortunately, the GUI interface still remained underpowered in comparison to the command line. To this day, there are operations that are trivial on the command line that are impossible from the GUI, and some things you can do in the GUI that are still far more efficient from the command line. One of my frustrations with Windows, in fact, is how many different programs are written and even sold for cash money that perform the sorts of operations that can be done using a UNIX command line from a free as in beer operating system with just a few keystrokes. This is also illustrated by the Automator program on Macs, if any of you have played with that. Apple took various generic UNIX commands - like, "divide this file into many files by paragraphs" or "create a pdf" and attached them to buttons which can be placed in whatever order you wish them to run, with a file input and an output. Or you could just use the command line by typing in the text commands and running the script without bothering with Automator, which frankly by comparison feels a little slow and clunky and limiting to me, even though it allows you to write and run scripts in the GUI. I encourage all of you to dive into using the command line, not only because you need it for some of the privacy and security things we're about to do, but because it will make you a much powerful computer user. It might seem weird at first if you've never used it, but it's really not that mysterious once you learn a few simple commands.

						<h2>GNUPG</h2>
						<img width="448" height="274" src="images/security.png">
						<aside class="notes">
						Pretty Good Privacy enables you to encrypt your email and files, and also ensure that the people you think you are emailing are really the people you are emailing. You do this by creating a public and private key for yourself using cryptographic sotware. The person on the other end of the communication also creates their own public and private key. You exchange public keys. When you encrypt email destined for that person, your system encrypts it in such a way that only that person's system with its private key installed can decrypt it. We will be using GNUPG, also known as GPG, to accomplish this. Although it's probably the best option available, it's not trivial to get it running.
